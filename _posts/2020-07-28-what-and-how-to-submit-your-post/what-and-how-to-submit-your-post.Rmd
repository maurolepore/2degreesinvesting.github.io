[The first post on this blog encouraged you to submit your own posts](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/posts/2020-06-02-shape-and-share-your-thoughts-here/); but the advice was vague about what to submit or how. This post makes the advice concrete.

## What to submit

Each published article needs only two things:

* A title, e.g. "Publish your post here".

* A body, i.e. the contents of your post.

And it is nice to have a few optional things:

* A description, e.g. "Details on what and how to submit a new blog post".

* A link to your website, e.g. <https://github.com/maurolepore>.

* An image that is licensed to share publicly, e.g. from <https://www.pexels.com/creative-commons-images/>.

* One or more categories to help readers filter similar posts, e.g. "meta".

Most of this is just plain text, which is easy to submit for publication in a number of ways.

## How to submit

The priority is to publish your content; how you do it is unimportant -- you may submit it however you like. For example, here are some ways:

* Slack: Send me or Jackson a file via Slack with your text or a link to it (e.g. a link to a Google Doc).

* GitHub: On GitHub, [create a new file](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/2degreesinvesting.github.io/new/master) and paste your text in it.

GitHub will automatically fork the blog's repo into your user account and guide you to create a pull request.

* RStudio: Fork the blog's repo; create a new RStudio project from your fork; create a new post with `distill::create_post()`; commit your changes; push your commits to your fork; submit a pull request to the blog. 

Get to the pull request stage as quickly as possible so we discuss your post early. The technical details don't matter (we'll help you with that). What is important is your idea -- share it.
